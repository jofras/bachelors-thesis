# uncovering and mitigating sociocultural bias in public discourse datasets. 

supervised by [dr. Alexander Hoyle](https://alexanderhoyle.com) and [prof. Ryan Cotterell](https://rycolab.io/authors/ryan/).

the project is now bigger:
- the original goal of training word embeddings on a [relatively new corpus](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07892) and evaluating their performance pre- and post-debiasing (using various algorithms) remains.
- because of a recent finding, i will also be investigating whether the model used for podcast transcription hallucinates context-dependently.

i am currently working on integrating database creation into the preprocessing pipeline.
